# Deep_Learning

Deep learning is based on the branch of machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence. Since neural networks imitate the human brain and so deep learning will do. In deep learning, nothing is programmed explicitly. Basically, it is a machine learning class that makes use of numerous nonlinear processing units so as to perform feature extraction as well as transformation. The output from each preceding layer is taken as input by each one of the successive layers.

 Deep learning algorithms are used, especially when we have a huge no of inputs and outputs.

Since deep learning has been evolved by the machine learning, which itself is a subset of artificial intelligence and as the idea behind the artificial intelligence is to mimic the human behavior, so same is "the idea of deep learning to build such algorithm that can mimic the brain".

Deep learning is implemented with the help of Neural Networks, and the idea behind the motivation of Neural Network is the biological neurons, which is nothing but a brain cell.

So basically, deep learning is implemented by the help of deep networks, which are nothing but neural networks with multiple hidden layers.

## Types of Deep Learning Networks

## 1. Feed Forward Neural Network

A feed-forward neural network is none other than an Artificial Neural Network, which ensures that the nodes do not form a cycle. In this kind of neural network, all the perceptrons are organized within layers, such that the input layer takes the input, and the output layer generates the output. Since the hidden layers do not link with the outside world, it is named as hidden layers. Each of the perceptrons contained in one single layer is associated with each node in the subsequent layer. It can be concluded that all of the nodes are fully connected. It does not contain any visible or invisible connection between the nodes in the same layer. There are no back-loops in the feed-forward network. To minimize the prediction error, the backpropagation algorithm can be used to update the weight values.

## Applications:

* Data Compression

* Pattern Recognition

* Computer Vision

* Sonar Target Recognition

* Speech Recognition

* Handwritten Characters Recognition


## 2. Recurrent Neural Network
Recurrent neural networks are yet another variation of feed-forward networks. Here each of the neurons present in the hidden layers receives an input with a specific delay in time. The Recurrent neural network mainly accesses the preceding info of existing iterations. For example, to guess the succeeding word in any sentence, one must have knowledge about the words that were previously used. It not only processes the inputs but also shares the length as well as weights crossways time. It does not let the size of the model to increase with the increase in the input size. However, the only problem with this recurrent neural network is that it has slow computational speed as well as it does not contemplate any future input for the current state. It has a problem with reminiscing prior information.

## Applications:

* Machine Translation

* Robot Control

* Time Series Prediction

* Speech Recognition

* Speech Synthesis

* Time Series Anomaly Detection

* Rhythm Learning

* Music Composition


## 3. Convolutional Neural Network

Convolutional Neural Networks are a special kind of neural network mainly used for image classification, clustering of images and object recognition. DNNs enable unsupervised construction of hierarchical image representations. To achieve the best accuracy, deep convolutional neural networks are preferred more than any other neural network.

## Applications:

* Identify Faces, Street Signs, Tumors.

* Image Recognition.

* Video Analysis.

* NLP.

* Anomaly Detection.

* Drug Discovery.

* Checkers Game.

* Time Series Forecasting.
